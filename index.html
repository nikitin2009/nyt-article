          CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
          physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment at
          Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations, venturing
          far beyond the world of known physics.
        </p>

        <p>
          He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
          particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
          discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A
          potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have
          infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
          force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
          for a prodigiously violent instant.
        </p>

        <p>
          If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the
          heavens look uniform from pole to pole and not like a jagged, warped
          mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and
          irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted
          beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.

          <h2>The Theory of Inflation</h2>
          <p>
            Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
            which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
            in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                <span>THE UNIVERSE</span>&nbsp; is just under 14 billion years
                old. From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
                sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
                there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                temperature.

                <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>&nbsp; The universe is not old
                enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
                time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                temperature.

                <span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>&nbsp; At a smaller scale, imagine
                using a telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a
                coffee cup, and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its
                temperature and how much it has cooled.

                mile in the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at
                exactly the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see
                a similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for
                another explanation.

                enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before they
                get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a
                single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain
                their even temperature.

                <span>INFLATION </span>&nbsp; solves this problem. The theory
                proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big
                Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny
                ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew
                into the large-scale structures of the universe.

                <span>FLUCTUATION </span>&nbsp; Astronomers have now detected
                evidence of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized
                light in the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left
                over from the early universe. These are gravitational waves
                predicted by Einstein.

                <span>EXPANSION </span>&nbsp; Returning to our coffee, imagine a
                single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to
                an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth
                and foam of the original pot.

        <p>Andrei Linde of Stanford, a prolific theorist who first described the most popular variant of inflation, known as chaotic inflation, in 1983, was about to go on vacation in the Caribbean last week when Chao-Lin Kuo, a Stanford colleague and a member of Dr. Kovac’s team,
           <a href="#">knocked on his door with a bottle of Champagne</a>
           to tell him the news.

       <p>Dr. Kovac has spent his career trying to read the secrets of these waves. He is one of four leaders of Bicep, which has operated a series of increasingly sensitive radio telescopes at the South Pole, where the thin, dry air creates ideal observing conditions. The others are Clement Pryke of the University of Minnesota, Jamie Bock of the California Institute of Technology and Dr. Kuo of Stanford.
       </p>

       <p>“The South Pole is the closest you can get to space and still be on the ground,” Dr. Kovac said. He has been there 23 times, he said, wintering over in 1994. “I’ve been hooked ever since,” he said.
